# BERT Re-implementations

Google Researchers' [original BERT implementation](https://github.com/google-research/bert/) does not support multi-task learning, which we can greatly profit from for this challenge to train all label classifiers at the same time. Thus, it was necessary to re-implement many methods from the original code in order to use it. Gladly, Javaid Nabi did this in [this notebook](https://github.com/javaidnabi31/Multi-Label-Text-classification-Using-BERT/blob/master/multi-label-classification-bert.ipynb?source=post_page---------------------------). This folder simply incorporate the researchers' code with his by adapting the necessary scripts.
